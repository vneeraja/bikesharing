# NYC Citibikesharing

## Overview of the project
Work needs to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines like in NYC is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

We will create a set of visualizations to:

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
Finally, weâ€™ll use these visualizations for our final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

## Results
